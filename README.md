# University-of-California-Irvine--Projects
Below are highlights of projects and lab assignments I have completed so far at UC Irvine.

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Electronics III (EECS 170C) Lab Assignments:
  
  I designed and simulated integrated circuit modules including multi-stage amplifiers and operational amplifiers using Cadence. The main component of the circuits included BJTs and MOSFETS. There were six lab assignments in total and each took approximately 3 to 4 hours. I received an A+ in the class.

Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Computer Aided Design (MAE 52) Final Project:
  
  I utilized Solidworks to design and construct a construction loader.
